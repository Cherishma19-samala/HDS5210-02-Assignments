It clearly understood the context of my course well presented me with a few ideas for the projects on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and guided me in planning my project. However, in the case of the provided datasets, links often failed or were too detailed for my requirements to continue. Further, a code was given which was helpful as the starting point, but the expectations from the data are considered hence it is not as directly useful. Better recommendations regarding the alteration of the code and plain, functional datasets would have been useful. In general, the responses were useful but they would have provided more use if they gave more specific links to useable resources and datasets.\n",
